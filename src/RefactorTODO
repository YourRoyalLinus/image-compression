Control Flow:
    - Accept a file or list of files
        - For each file [COMPRESS]:
            . Convert file to BMP (if necessary)
            . Get File Header Info
            . Build Huffman Tree
            . Write Huffman codes into new file  
            . Create and Encode Huffman Table into extra space After Header Info and Before Pixel encodings (using serialization) <- ADDITIONAL RESEARCH MAY BE REQUIRED
            . Update Header Info
            . Write Header into file
            . Flush file
            . Report execution info
        - For each file [DECOMPRESS]:
            . Open encoded file
            . Get File Header Info
            . Get Huffman Table (deserialiazation)
            . Read codes one-by-one and convert back to pixel values and append to array <- RADDITIONAL RESEARCH MAY BE REQUIRED
            . Display Image/Save decompressed image to new file
            . Report execution Info
REFACTOR TODO (Frequent GitHub Pushes):
- Write code to Encode Huffman table after Header <- CURRENT
- Write code to read Huffman Table in Decoding
- Finish writing Decoding algorithm
- Test Encoding and Decoding process and verify
    - Build Test classes (100pct coverage)?
- Refactor all functions and classes "Cleanly"
- Update Makefile to include CImg and serialization lib
- Create Github ReadMe
